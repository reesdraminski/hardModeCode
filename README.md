# hardModeCode
A user-hostile environment meant to test your coding precision and prowess as you complete coding challenges, all without being able to edit your code once you type it.

## TODO
- Duplicate Filename Resolution
- Improve code output UI
- Add built-in code challenges
- Run test cases instead of doing output comparison
